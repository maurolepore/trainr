Description: Reproducible but static 'rmarkdown' documents
    abund. For example, many R packages include them in README.Rmd and
    vignettes. You can transform each 'rmarkdown' code chunk into an R
    console using the learnr exercises
    (<https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/exercises.html>). But the
    transformation can be tedious (e.g. label unlabeled code chunks and
    chain exercises setup).  This package automates the process -- to
    easily create interactive exercises from static, reproducible
    'rmarkdown` documents in the wild.
